Assessment Task
1. 
I am working with a remote team for example” Remote Kitchen” and I am being asked to do following:
For creating any branch for bug fix cerate it as 'hotfix/BUGFIX_NAME'
For any feature branch create it as 'feature/FEATURE_BRANCH_NAME'
I  would need to create  individual branches by your names separately work on your named branch and create any branch of your task under it. When I finished task, then merge any task in my  named branch, then we can   merge it in the current feature branch or hotfix branch
If I need to work on featureX so I will be doing:
git checkout -b myname/featureX
In future I need to create more features so I may do:
git checkout -b myname/featureY
Is it common/right way to name branches this way or should I do below:
git checkout -b myname

then:
git checkout -b featureX myname
git checkout -b featureY myname
